Sea of Tweets
=========

Real time visualization of tweets.

  - Visualize tweets in real time through the Streaming API
  - Tweets as *Waves* (height and length of the tail based on followers)
  - Based on Node.js and Socket.IO
  - Ready to be published on OpenShift

The project started as a real time visualization of what Italians were talking about during the election in 2013. Later on it has evolved into a more generic visualization of what Italians are talking about (mailny politicians though).
